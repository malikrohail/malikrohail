Hi, I’m Malik 👋 — an **AI/ML-focused Software Engineer** building **production-grade AI systems end-to-end** (model training → inference → APIs → mobile apps → cloud deployment).

- **B.A. Computer Science & Mathematics, Bennington College (Graduated May 2025)**  
- Interests: **LLMs (RAG/agents), multimodal AI, speech/vision, mobile-first AI products, scalable infra**  
- I build: **real-time inference APIs**, AI-backed web/mobile apps, and **GPU/container/serverless deployments** optimized for **latency + cost + scale**  

**Highlight:** Built a **speech intelligence platform** (Whisper ASR + diarization + speaker verification) with streaming + GPU autoscaling.
